    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Retargeting is a very common technique in online advertising business these days, but it is a very simple technology. Sometimes it "magically" brings high lift for advertising, but because of its simplicity, it can cause some epic fail.<br/></p>

<br/>


<p>I have been using NewRelic services these days, so I go to its site pretty often. Today when I was reading an article on 9to5mac.com, I found out that there are 8 ads about NewRelic on the same page for me. It is not 1, not 2, not 4, IT IS EIGHT ads about the same company. And these 8 ads almost have the same creative. Seriously?! Really?!<br/></p>

<br/>


<p>I am not able to take a full screen shot of this page, but this page is a great example of epic failure of retargeting.</p>
