<div class="entry-content">I have been in China for about 4 months and half now and I am &#8220;honored&#8221; to have the opportunity to deal with several major local banks in China. As you may know, China banking system are mainly controlled by four major national-owned banks: ICBC, CCB, ABC and BOC. I dealt with three of them in 4 months: ICBC, ABC and CCB.<br/>
<br/>
Let me start with ICBC. It is the largest of four, so when I wanted to open an account in Hangzhou, I decided to go to ICBC first for the brand. Unfortunately because of the <a title="工行开户趣闻" href="http://9kmiles.wordpress.com/2011/08/14/%e5%b7%a5%e8%a1%8c%e5%bc%80%e6%88%b7%e8%b6%a3%e9%97%bb/">stupidity of their banking system</a>, they had my name wrong in their system for the account I had in college. Because of that, I would not be able to open any new account with ICBC throughout the country unless I went back to that original branch and change my name in the system with my ID. (Notes: China banks are very fragmented, e.g. ICBC Shanghai is kinda independent from ICBC ZheJiang Province, which means I cannot do that name change thing in Hangzhou). And after that I had to go to ICBC twice because our server provider uses them as their bank. I did the exact same transaction in two different branches in Shanghai and they follow totally different workflow. And in order to do a simple transaction, I had to talk to 2 different staff. The process is horrible.<br/>
<br/>
For ABC, after I got turned down by ICBC and I ended opening the account in ABC. The staff is pretty friendly and I opened my online banking as well in order to use my account for online payment with Alipay. In China, online banking is still not that popular, so you have to pay some money to open it. And because of pirated software, the internet security is pretty bad as well. Thus when you open online banking account, they will give you a USB drive with security token in it and you have to use it every time you access online banking and doing online payment. So for the security USB drive from ABC, the good part is it works pretty well with VirtualBox under Mac OS X. (Yeah, those USB drives only work under Windows, so if you have a Mac like me, congratulations! You either need to do bootcamp or go with VirtualBox). Fortunately as I said, ABC one works with VirtualBox. After I opened the account with ABC, I started to experience the bad part, their online banking system sucks! I have experiences several failures when I tried to do online payment. And it was not even in their peak time during Taobao sale. It was really annoying. I am sure ABC spends a lot of money on their system, but I have to say it does not work very well at all!<br/>
<br/>
CCB, the second among the four banks, with which I have both business account and personal account with them. For the personal account, everything seems to be cool, but I have problem with their security USB token. It does not work with VirtualBox at all. I did some Google search and it turns out it only works with VMWare Phusion. I guess this is called &#8220;You get what you pay for&#8221;. Since I don&#8217;t wanna buy or install a pirated VMWare software, I have to use my old school ThinkPad T60 to do transactions now. For the business account, different branches have different levels. I went to one branch to do some deposit, I told the teller to put the correct reason for the money, but in the end she still put the wrong reason for it. Luckily that did not cause any problem for the money to go through, otherwise I would have had to do it twice.<br/>
<br/>
For my readers, key takeaways from my own experiences(highly biased) are:<br/>
<ul><br/>
	<li>If you use VirtualBox on Mac, try not to use CCB. And ABC one works pretty well!</li><br/>
	<li>ICBC services suck! Maybe because they are No. 1 and they do not need to improve anymore. You cannot become No. 0 like it is in computer system, right?</li><br/>
	<li>ABC services are good for me, but the bankend system prolly is the worst.</li><br/>
	<li>All these banks are very inefficient and it takes you in average 30 minutes to do a simple business there. And overall their technology is behind their US peers.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
