title: Exit Strategy NYC
---

<p>Yesterday one of my coworkers dropped us an email point out to an interesting iPhone App: <a href="http://www.exitstrategynyc.com/" target="_blank">Exit Strategy NYC</a>. <a href="http://bwong.net" target="_blank">One of the author</a> actually works full time in Morgan Stanley as IT associate.Â I have to say it is a very nerdy and handy app. Even for myself, everyday I take the same subway and I already figure out where the door opens when the train stops depending on different model of the train. $1.99 for an app like this, I guess quite a few New Yorkers will buy it. Since I do not use MTA that much, I guess I probably gonna skip this one.</p>
