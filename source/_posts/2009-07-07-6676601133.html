title: Register a cool domain name
---

<p>As we all know, common domains include .com, .net, .org, .info, .biz and etc. But at the same time, there are a lot of <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_code_top-level_domain">ccTLD (country code top-level domain)</a>. Thus by using these ccTLDs, you can register some cool domain name for yourself especially for people with a Chinese name. For example, .HU, Hungary domain, can be used for people whose last name is 胡, spelled as Hu in English; .GU, Guam domain, can be used for people whose last name is 顾. Please check out the table below:</p>
