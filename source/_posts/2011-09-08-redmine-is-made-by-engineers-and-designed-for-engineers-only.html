Since our project is getting more and more complicated, we have started to use some project management tool to help use to manage and track issues. Because we are a startup, we cannot afford fancy tools yet. Thus we picked <a href="http://www.redmine.org">Redmine</a>, a free open source tool. So far our impression is Redmine is made by engineers and its UX/UI is designed for engineers ONLY. Some simple operations, such as display all issues no matter whom it is issued to, needs some serious engineer thinking to achieve it.<br/>
<br/>
I am still very thankful for Redmine team to provide the world a good choice and I will write more feedback here later.
