title: Accessibility and You
---

<p>Today I went into an interesting talk by Chris Heilmann: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wait-till-i.com/2009/06/05/accessibility-and-you-my-brownbag-presentation-at-ebaygumtreepaypal/">Accessibilty and You</a>. Before I got into this talk, accessibilty means to provide better user interface for people with disability. Apparently I am wrong. In this talk, Chris mentioned: &#8220;The fastest growing segment of theÂ <span>U.S. </span>population is the 65 and over group.&#8221; <a target="_blank" href="http://lifetwo.com/production/node/20071114-the-middle-aged-discover-facebook-a-little-late-to-the-game">Some statistics</a> from facebook has a similar indication of the market shift. Baby boomers in US starts to become potential consumers of Web 2.0 technologies. When you are aging, you may start to have problems with vision, hearing, movement and etc. Thus accessibility is important for this group of people. Apple, a company providing great user experiences, just released a good feature with their newest <a target="_blank" href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/iphone-3gs/voice-control.html">iPhone 3GS</a>. I guess there is no best user interface, only better one =).</p>
