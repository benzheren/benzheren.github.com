Today I took written test for my driving license transfer, unfortunately I failed =( (in China, you need to get 90 out of 100 questions correct to pass the written test). On my way back, I was thinking about building a mobile app for driving test preparation. There are standard problem set (about 900 questions) online available. By using that dataset, it should be pretty easy to make an mobile app, which randomly generates tests and help you to memorize it. Anyone wanna give a try? =D
