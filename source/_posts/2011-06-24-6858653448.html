<p><img height="366" width="400" alt="@github for Mac" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ratLlAxp6ZU/TgLhbS29sxI/AAAAAAAAAh0/43gNAigKVIs/s400/github%252520for%252520mac.png"/></p>

<ol><li>The overall UI looks great and I can prolly stop using gitk for all my github projects.</li>

<li>There are some problems during scanning existing repos. Some of my repos do not get scanned correctly. Not sure why.</li>

<li>I hope there will be more keyboard shortcuts support so that I can go back and forth between commit view and repo view easily.</li>

</ol>
