title: An Annoying IE Bug
---

<p>Yesterday, I came across a very annoying IE bug: IE XMLHTTP implementation turns a standard 204 response code into a pretty random 1223 status code. Apparently it is an IE bug for a while, at least for both IE 7 and IE 8. And I found out a pretty cool <a href="http://www.enhanceie.com/ie/bugs.asp">website</a> to track IE bugs.</p>

<p>I am not an <a href="http://www.msboycott.com/super/">anti-Microsoft</a> person, but Microsoft Internet Explorer is really one of a kind. These days when the whole industry is trying to embrace standards, IE products are behind the industry standards movement. IE6 is already a disaster for web developers and a lot of new <a href="http://mashable.com/2009/08/11/orkut-ie6/">websites</a> already stop supporting it. IE8 has made some good improvements, hope Microsoft can incorporate more open standards into its IE product and fix those annoying bugs.</p>
