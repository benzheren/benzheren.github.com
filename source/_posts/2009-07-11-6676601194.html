title: SNS in China
---

<p>Today I read an <a target="_blank" href="http://www.donews.com/Content/200907/6ebcc799-d9b8-46e3-bca3-ba153b4e5b7a.shtm">article</a> from a Chinese tech site, it talks about the development of SNS industry in China. As we all know, after MySpace and Facebook took off in US, there are tons of copycats in China such as XiaoNei.com, KaiXin.com, KaiXin001.com and etc. There are a lot of competition between these early adopters, and you can even tell from their names: KaiXin.com and KaiXin001.com belong to two different companies and one of them is suing the other one. There are a lot of new comers, for example, Sohu.com is launcing its own SNS site. There are a lot of problems within this industry in China. Although they copy the idea pretty fast, even the look and feel, they do not have a good technical architecture and a good business model.</p>

<p>Architecture wise, they have similar platform concept as Facebook and 3rd party developers can develope applications on that. But it does not provide a very good support for 3rd party applications developers and it leads to very few applications on the platform compared to thousands on Facebook.</p>

<p>Business model wise, they position themselves as SNS, but what they are doing are off the track of real Social Network concept. They use webpage games to attract users which is fine. But most webpage games provide things like gambling, stealing and etc. which are not positive. Some of them are trying to shift their business model to Twitter model.</p>

<p>Overall I think there is still a long way for SNS in China. Even in US, Facebook and MySpace are trying to find a good way to grow their business in a healthy way. SNS in China is trying to find a localized business model for China, and hopefully they can find a healthy way.</p>
