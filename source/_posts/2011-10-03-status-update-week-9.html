Alright, this is week #9 and it is Monday today ( I have to check the calendar to make sure that I am correct because of the National Day holidays in China). Usually Matt wrote weekly status update on Mondays, but he was sick from yesterday and pretty busy, so it is my turn to write a weekly update. I cannot guarantee the same quality of English, but I will try to keep the style.<br/>
<br/>
The past week was an interesting week. As some of you might know, my post from last week about the short weekend trip in Shanghai <a href="http://cn.technode.com/archives/4853/">got reposted</a> by <a href="http://cn.technode.com">Technode</a> Chinese site. It was a pretty exciting thing for me, since it is probably the first time in my life that my writing gets picked by some journalists.  Since they mentioned my name in the repost, it was the publicity for our startup. It is a good start and we need more when we are ready to show the world what we are building. =D<br/>
<br/>
Other than the exciting news, last week we spent most of time working on the weekly release. We got quite a few <a href="https://www.miihuu.com/thankyou">feedback</a> and found out problems ourselves as well. This involves both front-end UI improvements and make the backend more stable and self healing when problems came up so that we wont keep ourselves up in the near future. Although there are very few users in the system, it helps to discover problems which we may not be able to catch early if only two of us are using the system. Since we tried to stick with the mid-week release date, we had to push a backend stability issue into a hotfix. We successfully finished both the release and hotfix before we headed back to Shanghai for the national holidays. Since we need to meet some people during the holidays, we decided to work in Shanghai for most of time and go out when we need to.<br/>
<br/>
The following week will be very critical, since the program is close to the end which means the final demo day is coming. We expect to spend quite a few time on dealing with demo preparation and company set-up stuff which will prevent us moving as fast as we did before on the product development. Thus we try to get our product in a good state in the following week, time to write more code and look forward to a new exciting week!
