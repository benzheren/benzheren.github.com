For the past two and half weeks, we have been working on the technical part of the project. However startup is not just about technology and there are other stuff like marketing, recruiting and etc.<br/>
<br/>
As a two-week-old startup/project, we were asked to work on a 12-month financial prediction yesterday. Before we started, we did not get the point why we need to this startup finance stuff this early. The financial form is structured in 5 sections: salary, office and equipment cost, operations and marketing, KPI and milestones. From my point of view, the excel sheet could start with milestones and KPI which determines how much people and infrastructure cost you need. That was how we started the whole excel.<br/>
<br/>
If it was difficult enough for us to decide our milestones and KPIs at this moment, it was even harder to decide salary cost and infrastructure cost. Since we do not know about market value of a programmer in China that well, we tried to ask other teams about their estimation of salary cost. The answers varied: different team have different requirements for programmers and there is huge gap between salary in first tier cities and that in second tie cities. A programmer salary could range from 3K RMB per month to 20K RMB per month. And because most of people have immediate financial pressure: home mortgage (average age of first home buyers in China is only 27) and increasing living cost, it is very hard to attract programmer even with market value. These all add up to the uncertainty of salary. We two decided that we would try our best to hire great programmers and we are willing to pay a decent market value for good programmers. We put down a pretty big number on the excel.<br/>
<br/>
For infrastructure cost, it is harder because there is <a title="Hosting Service in China" href="http://9kmiles.wordpress.com/2011/08/13/hosting-service-in-china/">no awesome service like AWS in China</a>: standard and easily to calculate cost. The cost structure of existing players make it very hard for us to calculate cost. VPS provides a virtual machine with spec like 8GB memory and 300GB harddrive. 300GB!!! It is even smaller than a home desktop these days. For us, we certainly need beefy machines with large storage. But in order to make our life easier, we standardize our prediction with machines of 8GB memory and 1TB harddrive (which is still too low).<br/>
<br/>
With all these difficulties, we still managed to finish the excel sheet. After that, we realized that it was actually a pretty good exercise. It helped us to think about how to value the success of our project in a year and provide us a chance to think about problems like salary, server cost and etc. Even if current numbers are pretty off, we will have a better idea next time.
